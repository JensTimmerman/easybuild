Installing EasyBuild
====================

EasyBuild is Python software, so there are a couple of ways to install it.
Because of various issues with the different installation tools that are available
for Python packages, we recommend using the **bootstrap** install procedure described here.

Notes on other ways of installing EasyBuild are available under section :ref:`alt_inst_methods`.

--------------


Bootstrapping EasyBuild
-----------------------

Installing any Python package can be a real pain, and since EasyBuild is
a set of Python packages (framework, easyblocks and easyconfigs) glued together,
installing EasyBuild may, ironically, also cause some headaches.

To resolve this, we have created a bootstrap script that installs the
latest EasyBuild version for you together with an environment module for
it - and yes, we use EasyBuild for doing so.

.. XXX - UPDATE BY VERSION, below

.. tip::
  All you really need as required `dependencies`_ are `Python 2.4 (or 2.x)`
  and `environment modules` (Tcl/C or Lmod variants) installed on your system, beforehand.
  Practically speaking, `a compiler able to build GCC` is desired for initiating most software builds,
  yet the EasyBuild framework, by itself, does not restrict you in what is possible.

Bootstrapping procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way (by far) to install EasyBuild is by bootstrapping it,
i.e. installing EasyBuild via EasyBuild itself.

Download the bootstrap script, and run it, specifying an install path
for EasyBuild, to obtain an ``EasyBuild`` module that you can then load::

    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework/develop/easybuild/scripts/bootstrap_eb.py
    python bootstrap_eb.py $HOME/.local/easybuild

.. note::

  The path you specify to the bootstrap script is where EasyBuild should be installed
  and ``$MODULEPATH`` should be aligned with it to make sure the EasyBuild module can be loaded,
  i.e. you should include .../modules/all in your $MODULEPATH.". If you also want
  software that is built using EasyBuild to be installed there, you will need to set
  ``$EASYBUILD_INSTALLPATH``, and/or look into the details on :ref:`configuring_easybuild`.

.. XXX - UPDATE BY VERSION

.. tip::

  The bootstrap script will only succeed if command ``module --version`` reports a sufficiently recent version
  (e.g., environments-modules-c >=v3.2.10 or Lmod >= 5.6.3), because modules are applied throughout,
  e.g., to resolve dependencies and detect already installed software.

Normally, only when the above fails to work for you for some reason, should you resort
to one of the alternative approaches documented at :ref:`alt_inst_methods`
(these are more involved but also they may give more control).


Sanity check
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set your ``$MODULEPATH`` correctly if needed, and load the EasyBuild
module with the specific version (see output of bootstrap script for more details)::

    export MODULEPATH=$HOME/.local/easybuild/modules/all:$MODULEPATH
    module load EasyBuild

Determine the version of the loaded EasyBuild, which should match the expected module::

    eb --version

.. tip::

  The Tcl-based or Lmod implementations of environment modules do their default sorting differently;
  The former will normally sort in the lexicographic order, while Lmod follows
  an approach that is closer to Python's construct ``LooseVersion`` way of ordering. Such aspects
  may make a big difference, if you have installed both versions 1.9.0 & 1.15.2 etc,
  about what is the default version.

Running unit tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After completion of the bootstrap procedure and loading the
``EasyBuild`` module, try running the EasyBuild unit tests::

    python -m test.framework.suite

If this does not complete successfully, `please open an issue`_ to report it.

.. _dependencies:

Dependencies
------------

EasyBuild has a couple of dependencies, some of them optional:

Required dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  **Linux** (or OSX) operating system; preferably x86_64 based
*  `Python 2.4 <http://python.org>`_, or a more recent 2.x version
*  `Tcl/C environment-modules  <http://modules.sourceforge.net/>`_ (version >= 3.2.10)
   or `Lmod <lmod.sourceforge.net>`_ (version >= 5.6.3)

  * environment-modules requires `Tcl <http://www.tcl.tk/>`_ to be
     installed (with header files and development libraries)
  * Lmod requires Lua and a couple of non-standard Lua libraries to be available
  * a guide on installing Tcl/C environment modules without having root
     permissions is available at :ref:`installing_env_mod_c`.
  * a guide on installing Lmod without having root permissions is available at
     :ref:`installing_lmod`.

*  a C/C++ compiler (optionally, to build GCC)

.. tip::  
 A packaged version of Tcl/C environment modules is available for 
 `RPM-based systems <https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2014-0327.html>`_ and
 `Debian/Ubuntu <https://packages.debian.org/testing/main/environment-modules>`_

Details
^^^^^^^

EasyBuild is written in Python, so a Python installation is indispensable.

EasyBuild not only generates module files to be used along with the
software it installs, it also depends on the generated modules for some
of its functionality. In practice, you need an environment modules (Tcl/C or Lmod) to make
full use of EasyBuildâ€™s features.

The C/C++ compiler is only required when an open-source compiler will be
used to build software applications. EasyBuild will construct a GCC
compiler toolchain first, before building the software applications, and
to build the compiler to be part of the toolchain from source typically
a C/C++ (system) compiler is required.

Required Python modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are no required dependencies on non-standard Python modules.

Optional dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some dependencies are optional and are only required to support certain features.

Optional Python modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  `GitPython <http://gitorious.org/git-python>`_, only needed if
   EasyBuild is hosted in a git repository or if youâ€™re using a git
   repository for easyconfig files (.eb)
-  `pysvn <http://pysvn.tigris.org/>`_, only needed if youâ€™re using an
   SVN repository for easyconfig files (.eb)
-  `python-graph-dot <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-graph-dot/>`_,
   only needed for building nice-looking dependency graphs using ``--dep-graph *.dot``.
-  `graphviz for Python <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/graphviz>`_,
   only needed for building nice-looking dependency graphs using ``--dep-graph *.pdf / *.png``.

Sources
-------

EasyBuild is split up into three different packages, which are available
from the Python Package Index (PyPi):

* `easybuild-framework <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild-framework>`_ - the EasyBuild framework, which includes the
   easybuild.framework and easybuild.tools Python packages that provide
   general support for building and installing software
* `easybuild-easyblocks <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild-easyblocks>`_ - a collection of easyblocks that implement
   support for building and installing (collections of) software
   packages
* `easybuild-easyconfigs <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild-easyconfigs>`_ - a collection of example easyconfig files
   that specify which software to build, and using which build options;
   these easyconfigs will be well tested with the latest compatible
   versions of the easybuild-framework and easybuild-easyblocks packages

Next to these packages, a meta-package named `easybuild <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/easybuild>`_ is also
available on PyPi, in order to easily install the full EasyBuild
distribution.

The source code for these packages is also available on GitHub:

* `easybuild-framework git repository <https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework>`_
* `easybuild-easyblocks git repository <https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyblocks>`_
* `easybuild-easyconfigs git repository <https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild-easyconfigs>`_
* the `main EasyBuild repository <https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild>`_ mainly hosts `this` EasyBuild documentation
